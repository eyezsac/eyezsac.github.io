Goal-oriented researcher with a strong research background in using advanced genomics techniques to improve sustainable agriculture. I am currently finishing a PhD in Mechanistic Biology at the University of York (currently awaiting viva!) and on the hunt for a role that would really let me flex my data and science communication skills.
